# Images
-----------
## *information*
Images seen anywhere in the github repository that are not captures of graphs or plots generated by the contributors should be saved in this directory.
Images that are captures of graphs or plots can be found the appropriate contributors analysis directory.


## *conventions*
It is preferred that images are saved as png files, so that there is uniformity amongst all saved images.
The naming convention for the images is, imgName_locationFound.png (*locationFound should be a basic name, i.e. if the image is found on Wikipedia.org, use Wikipedia*). This lets quickly deciper what the image is without having to open it. 

## *bibliography*
