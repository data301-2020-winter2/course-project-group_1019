## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
We are interested in videogames, and the statistics around it.

In combining these two interests, we want to carry out a data analysis on videogame data, specifically regarding the sales of videogames. 

We want to find correlations in the data and make conclusions from it, and also try to target and answer some more direct questions.

These questions include:
- How do console sales compare to PC sales?
- Do higher critic scores lead to more sales? 
- Do game more game ratings lead to more sales?
- Do the critics' ratings of games ever vary wildly from users'?

We are also interested in graphically representing the distribution of videogame sales, and perhaps, based on the dataset, be able to provide some insight into other areas. Such as, the age old questions of Consoles VS PC, and Xbox VS PlayStation based on sales and success of multi-platform games.

This data analysis and conclusions on our curiosities and questions can be presented in a Dashboard.
