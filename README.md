## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
-	We are interested in videogames, and statistics about it.
-	We want to find any correlation between the data and make conclusions.
o	How do console sales compare to PC sales?
o	Do higher critic scores lead to more sales?
o	Do game ratings lead to more sales?
o	Are critic scores for games usually close to user scores?
o	In the transition year when new gen consoles were released (2013), the games that sold on both old gen and new gen, which consoles sold better? Example – Assassin’s Creed IV which was on X360, PS3, XOne an PS4.
Or games that initially sold on old gen consoles and then were ported again to next gen – like GTA V, Battlefield 4, COD: Ghosts, etc.
o	Compare sales of consoles to handheld consoles.
-	This data analysis and conclusions to our questions and curiosities could be presented in a Dashboard.
