    "The data used in this analysis was obtained from [kaggle](\"https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings\"), and is a user compiled data set which extends a scrape already performed by Metacritic, *\"a website that aggregates reviews of films, TV shows, music albums, video games and formerly, books\"* [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic). It includes over 16,000 entries, of which 6,825 entries have all descriptors complete.\n",

    "Each entry in this dataset is a videogame, and various pieces of information relating to it. As the extracted information will show, this dataset does not contain all videogames from 1980-2016, and although it contains many entries, it does not contain all videogames from 1980-2016, and so in this analysis it is considered a sample of that set of all videogames.\n",
