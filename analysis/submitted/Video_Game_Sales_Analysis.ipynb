It includes over 16,000 entries, of which 6,825 entries have all descriptors complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in this dataset is a videogame, and various pieces of information relating to it. As the extracted information will show, this dataset does not contain all videogames from 1980-2016, and although it contains many entries, it does not contain all videogames from 1980-2016, and so in this analysis it is considered a sample of that set of all videogames.\n",
