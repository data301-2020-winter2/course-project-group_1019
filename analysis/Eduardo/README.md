##*All of the changes and work done by Eduardo will be documented in this README file*
---------------------------------

**Milestone 1**:
    This milestone was simple. All that was required was for us to successfully load in the raw dataset that had been selected and display the
    head of the dataset using pandas. This printed off the first five rows of the raw dataset which we had. 

**Milestone 2**:
    Milestone 2 was significantly longer and more complex than Milestone 1.
    For this milestone, there were **multiple** objectives which had to be completed. These included the following:
        Conducting a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
        Completing a more in-depth data analysis as a group (and individually).
        Creating a functions python file.
        Addressing some interesting questions and making conclusions around the dataset.
